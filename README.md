# react-ecommerce
Here’s the code for our React ecommerce store written during the nine-part video series from the **2hats Skills Accelerator: Front-End Web Dev** course.

The `master` branch contains the final code for the store.

Each module’s video has its own branch that cumulatively builds upon the code from the previous video.
